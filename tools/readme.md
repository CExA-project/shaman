## Shamanizer

Shamanizer is a script that can be used to automatically instruments a file or folder of C++ files with Shaman.

It changes the types, adds the required headers, fixes the `printf` and the calls to MPI.

**There is now a new, Clang-based, tool.**

## The Shaman Profiler

The shaman profiler give you a numerical profile of your application with the number of numerical unstabilities detected in each function and the exact line/operations where those unstabilities appeared.

**Tagged error is now the recommended way to trace the sources of numerical error in a computation.**
