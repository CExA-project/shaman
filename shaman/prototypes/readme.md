# Visions of the future

A place to quickly test various potential improvement for Shaman :
- **classic_shaman** a quick implementation of shaman in F#
- **increased_precision** an implementation that increases the number of precision terms dynamically with the conditioning of the problem
- **tagged_error** an implementation that keep track of the functions in which an error was produced

Note that all the code is done using [F# scripts](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/languages/fsharp/) without any performance consideration.
