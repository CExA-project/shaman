add a better way to visualize informations on top of the code ?

speed-up the debugger, maybe by using libunwind from C++ instead of a gdb script
(posibility to get all of the informations directly from C++ without giving the hand to a debugger)
see this tutorial for additional informations :
https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/programmatic-access-to-the-call-stack-in-c/

it would be very usefull to get a true profiler output
up to know the output has been focusses on numerical "bugs" (cancelation and such)
but most precision is lost gradualy
it would be precious to get the evolution of relative error line by line
a simple solution is, for every operation, to compute the evolution of the |relative error| (or just the absolute error produced ?)
then, for each file/line in the stackframes, add that value to the line
at the end of the run we have informations on the numerical behaviour of each line/function (the sum of precision modifications)
