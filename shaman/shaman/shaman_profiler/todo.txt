some shaman function call other shaman functions
+(double,S<double>) will call +(S<double>,S<double>)
this will result in a profile inside shaman and not inside the actual code

some stl function such as std::max are also suceptible to call shaman function and to lose the frame

add a way to visualize information on top of the code ?
speed-up the debugger
