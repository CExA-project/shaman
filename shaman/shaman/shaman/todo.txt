we might add a flag to active a boolean that tracks wether
a value comes from an operation that might distord our error tracking

the numerical debugger will detect the presence of such problems
but not tell us if they were involved in the compatation of our value of interest

std::function calls can be replaced by function calls but the NO_SHAMAN flag will not work anymore
the ideal solution would be to overload std functions
